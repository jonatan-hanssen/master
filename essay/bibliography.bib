    abstract = {Understanding and interpreting classification decisions of automated image classification systems is of high value in many applications, as it allows to verify the reasoning of the system and provides additional information to the human expert. Although machine learning methods are solving very successfully a plethora of tasks, they have in most cases the disadvantage of acting as a black box, not providing any information about what made them arrive at a particular decision. This work proposes a general solution to the problem of understanding classification decisions by pixel-wise decomposition of nonlinear classifiers. We introduce a methodology that allows to visualize the contributions of single pixels to predictions for kernel-based classifiers over Bag of Words features and for multilayered neural networks. These pixel contributions can be visualized as heatmaps and are provided to a human expert who can intuitively not only verify the validity of the classification decision, but also focus further analysis on regions of potential interest. We evaluate our method for classifiers trained on PASCAL VOC 2009 images, synthetic image data containing geometric shapes, the MNIST handwritten digits data set and for the pre-trained ImageNet model available as part of the Caffe open source package.},

abstract = {With an increase in deep learning-based methods, the call for explainability of such methods grows, especially in high-stakes decision making areas such as medical image analysis. This survey presents an overview of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) used in deep learning-based medical image analysis. A framework of XAI criteria is introduced to classify deep learning-based medical image analysis methods. Papers on XAI techniques in medical image analysis are then surveyed and categorized according to the framework and according to anatomical location. The paper concludes with an outlook of future opportunities for XAI in medical image analysis.}

  abstract  = {Nowadays, deep learning is a current and a stimulating field of machine learning. Deep learning is the most effective, supervised, time and cost efficient machine learning approach. Deep learning is not a restricted learning approach, but it abides various procedures and topographies which can be applied to an immense speculum of complicated problems. The technique learns the illustrative and differential features in a very stratified way. Deep learning methods have made a significant breakthrough with appreciable performance in a wide variety of applications with useful security tools. It is considered to be the best choice for discovering complex architecture in high-dimensional data by employing back propagation algorithm. As deep learning has made significant advancements and tremendous performance in numerous applications, the widely used domains of deep learning are business, science and government which further includes adaptive testing, biological image classification, computer vision, cancer detection, natural language processing, object detection, face recognition, handwriting recognition, speech recognition, stock market analysis, smart city and many more. This paper focuses on the concepts of deep learning, its basic and advanced architectures, techniques, motivational aspects, characteristics and the limitations. The paper also presents the major differences between the deep learning, classical machine learning and conventional learning approaches and the major challenges ahead. The main intention of this paper is to explore and present chronologically, a comprehensive survey of the major applications of deep learning covering variety of areas, study of the techniques and architectures used and further the contribution of that respective application in the real world. Finally, the paper ends with the conclusion and future aspects.},

ABSTRACT = {Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection separates ID (In-Distribution) data and OOD data from input data through a model. This problem has attracted increasing attention in the area of machine learning. OOD detection has achieved good intrusion detection, fraud detection, system health monitoring, sensor network event detection, and ecosystem interference detection. The method based on deep learning is the most studied in OOD detection. In this paper, related basic information on OOD detection based on deep learning is described, and we categorize methods according to the training data. OOD detection is divided into supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised. Where supervised data are used, the methods are categorized according to technical means: model-based, distance-based, and density-based. Each classification is introduced with background, examples, and applications. In addition, we present the latest applications of OOD detection based on deep learning and the problems and expectations in this field.},
